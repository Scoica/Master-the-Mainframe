'CC#####.P2.OUTPUT'. This data set is very important -- it will eventually contain all of your work to be graded for Part 2. 
From here on out, we will refer to this data set as OUTPUT or P2.OUTPUT. 
You'll need to keep its full name in mind to complete many of the Part 2 challenges successfully.

	Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence.                                                                         
	
	Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent.
	
	Genius will not: unrewarded genius is almost a proverb.          
	
	Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts.     
                                                                 
	Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.
